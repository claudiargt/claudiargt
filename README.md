# 👋😃 Well, hello there! I’m Claudia Garcia 

I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics student at UC Irvine’s Paul Merage School of Business, with a background in economics and marketing. I pivoted into analytics after working in multicultural marketing and realizing that many important business and user questions require stronger statistical and technical tools.

My interests sit at the intersection of data analytics, user experience, and marketing strategy, especially for user-focused platforms shaped by pop culture and fast-moving trends. I enjoy working with behavioral and transactional data to turn messy information into clear, actionable insights that support product and marketing decisions.

📌 [Here](claudia-analytics-projects) you will find selected analytics projects focused on product performance, user behavior, and marketing insights, primarily built using Python, SQL, and statistical modeling.

⭐️ Thanks for stopping by! I’m actively building and refining my projects as I continue learning, so feel free to explore and check back for updates.
