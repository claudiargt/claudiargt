# 👋😃 Well, hello there! I’m Claudia Garcia 

I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics student at UC Irvine’s Paul Merage School of Business, with a background in economics and marketing. I pivoted into analytics after working in multicultural marketing and realizing that many important business and user questions require stronger statistical and technical tools.

I’m particularly interested in how analytics supports planning, efficiency, and performance across complex, fast-moving organizations such as advertising and media teams. I enjoy working with behavioral and transactional data to turn messy information into clear, actionable insights that support product and marketing decisions.

📌 [Here](https://github.com/claudiargt/claudia-analytics-projects) you will find selected analytics projects focused on product performance, user behavior, and marketing insights, primarily built using Python, SQL, and statistical modeling. (Applications in operational decision making coming soon!)

⭐️ Thanks for stopping by! I’m actively building and refining my projects as I continue learning, so feel free to explore and check back for updates.
